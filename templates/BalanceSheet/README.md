# Balance Sheet Templates

Google Sheet and Excel versions of the balance sheet template linked here can be used for your analysis by doing the following: 
  1. Create an online copy of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NT6dPSJAu8GJX8pq-MlZ17ORixNW7nkW0pdIMq90nH4/edit?usp=sharing target="_blank">Google Sheet</a> or download [Excel 2013 or later](/templates/BalanceSheet/BSCompare.xlsx?raw=true) and/or [Excel legacy](/templates/BalanceSheet/BSCompare.xlsm?raw=true) files to your computer. 
  2. Replace the demo API key with your valid API key in the sheet (get a free API key from XBRL US at http://xbrl.us/apirequest). The demo key will expire, so copy your own key into the cell to replace the temporary API key.
  3. Customize the analysis by changing the green cells for ticker symbol and time periods requested.

Important: for the Google Sheet, there is a limit of 20,000 requests per day that you can make but again, the sheet can be copied to accommodate further data requests. Most data on these sheets is driven by the XBRL US database.
